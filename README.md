## Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Firebase ID token verification** on protected routes.
- **Role-based access**: `admin`, `user`, `rider`.
- **Middleware**: `verifyToken` (authenticated user), `verifyAdmin` (admin-only).
- Email-scoped data so users only access their own payments and parcels.

### User Management

- **Register** users (stored with role `user`).
- **List** users with optional search by display name or email.
- **Get role** by email (for client-side role checks).
- **Update/delete** user roles (admin only).

### Parcel Management

- **Create** parcels with auto-generated tracking IDs (`PRCL-YYYYMMDD-XXXXXX`).
- **List** parcels with filters: sender email, delivery status.
- **Rider view**: parcels by rider email and delivery status (excluding delivered).
- **Update delivery status** (e.g. `pending-pickup`, `driver_assigned`, `parcel_delivered`) with tracking logs.
- **Assign rider** to parcel and set rider work status to `in_delivery`.
- **Edit** parcel (name, cost).
- **Delete** parcel.
- **Tracking**: every status change is logged with timestamp for audit and tracking UI.

### Rider Management

- **Register** riders (initial status `pending`).
- **List** riders with filters: status, district, work status.
- **Approve/reject** riders (admin); on approval, user role set to `rider`.
- **Update** rider status and work status (`available`, `in_delivery`).
- **Delete** riders (admin).

### Payments

- **Stripe Checkout**: create session from parcel cost, name, sender email, parcel ID, tracking ID.
- **Success handler**: mark parcel as paid, set `deliveryStatus` to `pending-pickup`, store payment record, avoid duplicate processing by transaction ID.
- **List payments** by customer email (authenticated, email must match token).

### Tracking & Logs

- **Get tracking logs** by `trackingId` (chronological).
- **Logged events**: parcel created, paid, driver assigned, status updates (e.g. delivered, damaged, delayed).

### Admin Dashboard

- **Overview**: counts for new packages, ready for shipping, completed deliveries, new clients.
- **Shipment stats**: parcel counts aggregated by day of week.
- **Shipping reports**: recent parcels with client display name (e.g. last 10).
- **Late invoices**: recent payments (e.g. last 5).
- **Shipment alerts**: recent damaged/delayed tracking entries (e.g. last 5).
- **Revenue**: total revenue from payments collection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18+ recommended)
- **MongoDB** (local or [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))
- **Firebase** project with Authentication enabled
- **Stripe** account for payments

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd zap-shift-server

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below).  
Add your Firebase service account JSON (e.g. from Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts) and reference it in code (e.g. `zap-shift.json` or via an env path). **Do not commit this file or any secrets.**

### Run

```bash
# Development (default port 3000)
node index.js

# Or with explicit port
PORT=4000 node index.js
```

The server will connect to MongoDB and listen on the configured port. Use `GET /` to confirm it is running.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `PORT` | No | Server port (default: `3000`) |
| `DB_USER` | Yes | MongoDB Atlas username |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | Yes | MongoDB Atlas password |
| `STRIPE_KEY` | Yes | Stripe secret key (e.g. `sk_test_...` or `sk_live_...`) |
| `SITE_DOMAIN` | Yes | Frontend base URL for Stripe success/cancel redirects |

Firebase is configured via a service account JSON file (path used in code must match your setup). Keep this file and `.env` out of version control.
